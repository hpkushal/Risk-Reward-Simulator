## üéÆ How It Works

### Gameplay Loop

1. Start with $1,000 in virtual currency
2. Choose a betting event
3. Enter a bet amount or use the quick bet buttons
4. Place your bet and watch the outcome
5. Track your progress toward the $10,000 goal
6. Adapt your strategy based on your risk level
7. Try to avoid bankruptcy!

### Risk Calculation

Risk percentage is calculated using a weighted formula considering:

```
Risk % = (Bet Size Factor √ó 50) +
         (Event Probability Factor √ó 30) +
         (Loss Impact Factor √ó 20)
```

Where:
- Bet Size Factor = Bet Amount / Current Balance
- Event Probability Factor = 1 - Event Win Probability
- Loss Impact Factor = Potential Loss / Current Balance

### Personas

Your risk level determines which persona you embody:

| Persona | Risk Range | Strategy | Max Bet |
|---------|------------|----------|---------|
| Baby Betsy | 0-30% | Conservative | 10% of balance |
| Midlife Crisis Mike | 31-70% | Balanced | 30% of balance |
| YOLO Yolanda | 71-100% | Aggressive | 100% of balance |

### Betting Events

| Event | Multiplier | Win Chance | Risk Level | Min Bet |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|---------|
| Coin Flip | 2.0x | 50% | Low | $10 |
| Dice Roll | 6.0x | 16.6% | Medium | $50 |
| Bullseye | 3.0x | 33% | Low | $30 |
| Roulette | 35.0x | 2.7% | High | $100 |
| Stock Market | 10.0x | 10% | Medium | $200 |
