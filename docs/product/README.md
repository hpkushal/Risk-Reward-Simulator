## Feature Details

### Risk Calculation

Risk is calculated using this weighted formula:

```
Risk % = (Bet Size Factor Ã— 50) +
         (Event Probability Factor Ã— 30) +
         (Loss Impact Factor Ã— 20)
```

Where:
- **Bet Size Factor** = Bet Amount / Current Balance
- **Event Probability Factor** = 1 - Event Win Probability
- **Loss Impact Factor** = Potential Loss / Current Balance

This creates a dynamic risk assessment that changes with:
- The user's current balance
- The type of bet selected
- The amount wagered

### Persona System Implementation

The persona system provides:

1. **Visual Representation**: Different character icons and themes
2. **Gameplay Guidance**: Suggested betting strategies
3. **Narrative Element**: Personality traits and descriptions
4. **Behavioral Nudges**: Maximum bet limits based on risk approach

As users' risk levels change, their persona shifts automatically, providing a new perspective on betting strategies.
