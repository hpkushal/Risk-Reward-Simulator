## Feature Details

### Dashboard Features

#### Risk Calculation

Risk is calculated using this weighted formula:

```
Risk % = (Bet Size Factor Ã— 50) +
         (Event Probability Factor Ã— 30) +
         (Loss Impact Factor Ã— 20)
```

Where:
- **Bet Size Factor** = Bet Amount / Current Balance
- **Event Probability Factor** = 1 - Event Win Probability
- **Loss Impact Factor** = Potential Loss / Current Balance

This creates a dynamic risk assessment that changes with:
- The user's current balance
- The type of bet selected
- The amount wagered

#### Persona System Implementation

The persona system provides:

1. **Visual Representation**: Different character icons and themes
2. **Gameplay Guidance**: Suggested betting strategies
3. **Narrative Element**: Personality traits and descriptions
4. **Behavioral Nudges**: Maximum bet limits based on risk approach

As users' risk levels change, their persona shifts automatically, providing a new perspective on betting strategies.

### Analytics Features

#### Pattern Recognition

The Pattern Recognition component detects potentially problematic gambling patterns such as:

- **Chasing Losses**: Increasing bet sizes after losses
- **High-Risk Betting**: Consistently choosing high-risk options
- **Rapid Betting**: Placing bets too frequently without adequate consideration
- **Martingale Strategy**: Doubling bet amounts after losses
- **Large Stakes**: Betting excessively large percentages of bankroll
- **Post-Win Overconfidence**: Taking greater risks after winning
- **Extended Loss Streaks**: Continuing to bet despite consecutive losses

Warnings are categorized by severity (high, medium, low) and include actionable recommendations.

#### Predictive Analytics

The Predictive Analytics component forecasts future outcomes based on current betting patterns:

- **Balance Projections**: Estimated future balance after a selected number of bets
- **Win Rate Projections**: Predicted success rate based on current trends
- **Bankruptcy Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of potential for significant bankroll depletion
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Specific advice based on projected outcomes

Users can adjust the projection period (10, 25, or 50 bets) to see different time horizons.

#### Goal Setting

The Goal Setting component allows users to set and track responsible gambling targets:

- **Maximum Bet Size**: Setting limits on bet size as a percentage of bankroll
- **Session Time Limits**: Establishing maximum duration for betting sessions
- **Daily Bet Limits**: Restricting the number of bets placed per day
- **Average Risk Level**: Setting targets for overall risk exposure
- **Break Frequency**: Establishing how often to take breaks between bets
- **Profit Targets**: Setting goals for when to stop after winning
- **Loss Limits**: Setting thresholds for stopping after losses

Progress towards goals is tracked visually and updated based on betting behavior.
